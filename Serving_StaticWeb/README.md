# Nginx Basics

## Introduction to Nginx

### What is Nginx?
Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a versatile software widely used as:
- A **web server** to serve static and dynamic content.
- A **reverse proxy server** to manage and route client requests to the appropriate servers.
- A **load balancer** to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.

### Why Choose Nginx?

- Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, low resource consumption, and scalability. It is a popular choice compared to other web servers like Apache due to its ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

## Installation and Setup

- Learn how to install Nginx on various operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).

- Understand the Nginx directory structure and key configuration files (nginx.conf, /etc/nginx/).

### Installation on Various Operating Systems

- Configure a basic Nginx server to serve static content.

- Learn about server blocks (equivalent to Apacheâ€™s Virtual Hosts).

- Set up multiple server blocks for different domains.

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
